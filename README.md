OriginZ Skin Editor for LBmaster Repaint System.

![Skin Editor Screenshot](https://github.com/SigWars/OrgemZSkinEditor/blob/Readme_img.png)

Due to the large size of the file due to the skin configuration for the Repaint mod, I decided to create this editor to make it easier and avoid errors when saving the json.

Feel free to edit, modify and do whatever you want.

A pre-compiled executable is inside the SkinEditor\json-editor-app\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\json-editor-app.exe

Just run it
