Due to the large size of the file due to the skin configuration for the Repaint mod, I decided to create this editor to make it easier and avoid errors when saving the json.

*Feel free to edit, modify and do whatever you want.*

A pre-compiled executable is inside the **"SkinEditor\json-editor-app\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\json-editor-app.exe"**. Just run it.

To add new category just add **"--"** before your category name.

**Bugs:**
- When copying or moving category items or moving items up or down it visually shows the outdated or out of context parameters.

*Solution:* Save the file after copying or moving and Load file again.

*Note:* I will fix this in the future when I have time.
